# movie_gallery

This application contains some movies

I used the <b>clean architecture</b> for file managment, and the <b>RESTful requests</b> for uploading images and information about movies

Also the prject contains:
 - Caching information
 - Handling the event, when the information is not ready
 - Autocomplete the list of movie, when the user scrolls to down
